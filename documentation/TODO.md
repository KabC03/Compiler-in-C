# TODO


## Libraries:

  - Stack (generic stack - but make one implementation for size_t)
  - Shunting Yard (use two stacks)
  - AST
  - Map (generic but also allow str -> size_t)
  - Vector (also make it work with strings)
  - VM tokenising. Make labels more efficient. Stop doing realloc every loop. Free VM memory upon failure. Make sure everything works
  - VM - make sure allocate/free work as well as RAM store/LOAD
  - Write syntax for IR
  - Datastructures (stack, queue, LL, tree)
  - Pool allocator


  - Vectors:
  - vector_insert_end
  - vector_push_back
  - vector_pop_back
  - vector_clear
  - vector_shrink_to_fit
  - vector_set_size (set the size of the vector)
