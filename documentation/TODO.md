# TODO

Counter of amount of times I have deleted the tokeniser/parser to start over: 5 ;)


## This is a brief TODO document I keep for myself so I dont have to remember what I need to come back and do

- Complete the new tokeniser
- Redo the entire parser (again), this time it accepts the FULL program as a token array, recursively decent parse it





## Low priority

- Redo all library documentation
- Make everything return the return codes.h enum
- Also check for malloc overflow
