# Language

The language is a compiled/intepreted low level language designed to mesh well with a variety of computer organisations.

Similar to C, a high level of control is provided over the computer's resources while also providing a high level of abstraction over control structures.

No runtime checks are performed on compiled code. It is possible to write and execute unsafe code.
